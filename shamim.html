              <p><h3>History</h3>
                 The sky lantern was invented since 200s during the Three Kingdoms period aiming to transfer the military messages. In the old difficult time, some villagers had to pack up and hide deep in the mountain, waiting till the spring come with chances to harvest again, only strong men can stay to protect their house. After the draconic winter, the men would release lanterns to the sky as a sign to lead villagers coming back their home. This practice happens every year, then in the early 19th century, the Lantern Festival has already been held annually on the 15th day in the first month of the lunar calendar when the spring planting season begins. In 2019, the festival will be held on February 19th at the Shifen Sky Lantern Square.

                 <p><h3>Spiritual Meaning of Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival</h3>
                 In the festival, people light up the lanterns with candles, then release them into the dark sky at the night. Taiwanese believe that writing their wishes on these lanterns will bring an abundant crop while married women wish for “adding a son” to increase more hands working on the farm. The lanterns will follow the wind, rise up to the sky to carry the wishes of prayers seeking the purification of their souls, not only formally telling the invocations for smooth childbearing and plentiful harvests but also alternatively speak all dreams them that being blessed with luck and good things. Pingxi Festival undoubtedly reveals the Taiwan spirit to the whole world.

                  <h4>Some tips to enjoy the festival</h4>
                  <ol>
                      <li>Check the lantern carefully in case of any external damage; the lantern cannot fly if the heated air leaking out.</li>
                      <li>Remember to write your wish on the lanterns.</li>
                      <li>Take a piece of oil-soaked joss paper and hook it to the wire piece at the bottom of the lantern.</li>
                      <li>Gently pull the lantern to open to sure that all four upper corners are fully open. Some should also hold the lantern at the bottom to provide enough heated air enters the lantern to push it upwards.</li>
